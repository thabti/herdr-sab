# herdr-toolkit

A layout plus five mods for the Herdr desktop app (plain ES modules, no build step).
Formerly herdr-sab. Internal ids keep the `sab` prefix (layout `sab`, mods `sab-*`, `sab.json`, `layout:sab` keys, the `.herdr-sab` install marker); don't rename them, it breaks existing installs. Only user-visible text says herdr-toolkit.
User docs live in `docs/GUIDE.md`. Its §11 "How it is built" covers the file map and design notes.

## Workflow

- **Land on `main`.** Commit straight to `main` and push. Don't open feature branches or PRs unless asked.
- **Keep this file current.** Every change that adds a feature, setting, convention or gotcha updates this file in the same commit.
- **Docs move with code.** A user-visible change also updates `docs/GUIDE.md` (feature section plus the settings table) and the README's "What you get" list when it's a headline feature.
- After a change: run `scripts/install.sh`. It syncs shared files, copies the mods into `~/.config/herdr-app`, and runs `herdr-app check` on each one. Herdr hot-reloads the mods.
- To force a reload: `herdr-app do layout.switch --name sab`. Check the result with `herdr-app status` (`"errors": []`) and `herdr-app shot <png>`. Never restart the user's app or `hc`.

## Code rules

- **Shared code.** Herdr mods can't import each other. Edit `sab/shared/*.js` only, then run `scripts/sync-shared.sh`, which copies it into `sab-tabs`, `sab-panel` and `sab-settings`. Never edit the copies.
- **Settings.**
  - A new setting gets a default in `DEFAULTS` (`sab/shared/config.js`) with a comment.
  - Add a control in `sab/mods/sab-settings/main.js` (`toggle` / `stepper` / `choice` / `chips`) and a row in the GUIDE settings table.
  - Read settings through `cfg()`.
- **API reference.** `gpui-kit.d.ts` in each mod is the SDK reference (`herdr`, `gpui-kit`, `gpui-base`). It's gitignored, so grep it for an element method before using it.
- **Panels** (`sab/mods/sab-panel/*.js`) stay alive while hidden:
  - Gate reads on `isShown(this.id)`.
  - Capture `key()` before any await and drop the result when it changed (the user moved to another pane).
  - Pass `{ cwd, on }` to every `exec`; `on` is a remote machine or null.
  - `watchFolder` is local-only.
- **Git safety.** Commit only the listed files (`--literal-pathspecs add -A -- <paths>`), never `git add -A` on the whole tree. Pushes go through `sh -c 'GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 exec git "$@"'` so they fail instead of waiting on a hidden prompt.
- **GitHub.** Run gh through `ghAs(account, …)` with the account from `ghAccount(root, on)`, which picks the logged-in account that can see the repo.
- **Derived files.** Each one keeps its "Derived from / Modified by" header. Add a `Modified for herdr-toolkit:` line when you change what it does.
- **Style.** No spinners: use slow `.loop("opacity")` dots, because `.spin()` redraws the whole window.

## Changes panel (`changes.js`)

- **Single repository:** the original Herdr/Kanso behaviour.
- **Branch as the title.** The panel header and the tab bar's Changes button show the branch (`paneFolder()` in `sab-tabs` returns the focused pane's `branch`), falling back to "Changes".
- **Folder that isn't a repository** (`changes.nested`):
  - `findRepos` runs `find` up to `changes.scanDepth` deep. It skips hidden folders and `node_modules`, `vendor`, `dist`, `build`, `target`, `Pods`, as well as repos nested in a found repo.
  - It rescans every 30 s and never scans `~` or `/`.
  - It caps at `changes.maxRepos` (default 100). `~/Documents/work/GitHub/mumzworld` holds 55 repos.
  - **Git calls are expensive.** Each one costs about 80 ms through macOS's `/usr/bin/git` (Xcode shim), so the number of calls matters more than what they do:
    - `readRepo` makes one `git status --porcelain=v2 --branch` call, which also gives the branch and HEAD. `diff --numstat` runs only for a dirty repo.
    - `baseOf` caches each repo's base for 5 min; `aheadOf` caches the ahead count per HEAD.
    - A watch event re-reads only its own repo. The 10 s timer does a full multi-repo read at most every 30 s.
    - On 54 repos that is 2.4 s per refresh, down from 9.4 s.
  - `readRepo` returns `{ root, name, files, branch, base, ahead }`. `target()` picks the repo for Commit and Create PR: the filter chip, else the repo of the open diff.
- **Create PR** (`createPr` in `lib.js`, also used by the PR panel):
  - Pushes the branch (`-u origin HEAD` on the first push), then runs `gh pr create --fill [--draft] --head <branch>`.
  - It returns `{ url, existed }`.
  - The button shows only when the branch isn't `defaultBranch()` and `ahead > 0`.

## Testing without the app

There is no test suite. To exercise a panel's logic, run it in Node with stub modules:

1. Register a loader hook (`module.register`) that maps `herdr`, `gpui-kit` and `gpui-base` to stub files:
   - `exec` → `child_process.execFile` returning `{ code, stdout, stderr }`.
   - Elements → a Proxy that records `child`/`children`/`id`/`on_click`.
   - `watchFolder` → a promise that rejects.
2. Drive `init` / `refresh` / `render` against throwaway repos in the scratchpad.

Two tricks:
- **Fake GitHub:** a local bare repo plus `git config url.<bare>.pushInsteadOf https://github.com/…`, and a fake `gh` script first on `PATH`.
- **Throwaway repos under zsh:** set the `GIT_AUTHOR_*`/`GIT_COMMITTER_*` env vars rather than splitting `git -c …` from a variable.

Never point a test that commits or pushes at the user's real repos.
